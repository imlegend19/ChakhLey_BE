# Django REST Framework Add Ons

**A collection package for Django REST Framework**<br>

`Django REST Framework Add Ons` is a collection package collected over a period of one year from various sources.<br>
In each function/class I've specified its source in `docstrings` inside `Source` / `Sources`.<br> 
Wherever there isn't any source, the module has been created by me for my personal use.<br>
This may come in handy to all those who are going to use `Django REST Framework` for creating `API`.<br>

Contributors: **WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE IN DOCS**
